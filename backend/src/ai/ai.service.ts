Section Types by Archetype:
- PR1ME: WARMUP → WAVE (main lift) → SUPERSET (secondary) → Optional FINISHER → COOLDOWN
- FORGE: WARMUP → SUPERSET (Block A) → SUPERSET (Block B) → Optional FINISHER → COOLDOWN
- ENGIN3: WARMUP → EMOM (skill + engine + loaded movement) → Optional FINISHER → COOLDOWN
- CIRCUIT_X: WARMUP → AMRAP (4-8 min) → AMRAP (4-8 min) → Optional FINISHER → COOLDOWN
- CAPAC1TY: WARMUP → CAPACITY (12-20 min long block) → COOLDOWN
- FLOWSTATE: WARMUP → FLOW (tempo work, KB flows, slow EMOMs) → COOLDOWN

INTERVAL Section Type (Sprint Sessions):
- Use INTERVAL for sprint/interval work with specific work:rest ratios
- Examples: 20s max bike, 100s rest, repeat 6-10 rounds
- Common patterns: 20s/100s, 30s/90s, 40s/80s, 15s/45s
- Total time = (intervalWorkSec + intervalRestSec) × intervalRounds
- Perfect for REVL-style sprint sessions, power development, anaerobic capacity
- Can be used as FINISHER or standalone section

CRITICAL: EVERY SECTION MUST HAVE A TIME - NO EXCEPTIONS:
- WARMUP: REQUIRED durationSec: 300-600 seconds (5-10 min). HYROX: 600-900 seconds (10-15 min)
- COOLDOWN: REQUIRED durationSec: 300 seconds (5 min). HYROX: 300-600 seconds (5-10 min)
- WAVE: REQUIRED durationSec: 600-1200 seconds (10-20 min) - total time for all waves
- SUPERSET: REQUIRED durationSec: 600-900 seconds (10-15 min) - total time for superset block
- AMRAP: REQUIRED durationSec: 480-1800 seconds (8-30 min) - countdown timer duration
- FOR_TIME: REQUIRED durationSec: 600-3600 seconds (10-60 min) - time cap
- CAPACITY: REQUIRED durationSec: 720-1800 seconds (12-30 min) - long conditioning block
- FINISHER: REQUIRED durationSec: 180-600 seconds (3-10 min) - short high-intensity block
- FLOW: REQUIRED durationSec: 600-900 seconds (10-15 min) - tempo/mobility work
- EMOM: REQUIRED emomWorkSec + emomRestSec + emomRounds (total time = (workSec + restSec) × rounds)
- INTERVAL: REQUIRED intervalWorkSec + intervalRestSec + intervalRounds (total time = (workSec + restSec) × rounds)

TIME MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES:
- WARMUP: 5-10 minutes (movement prep, activation, light cardio). HYROX: 10-15 minutes
- COOLDOWN: 5 minutes (mobility, stretching, breathing). HYROX: 5-10 minutes
- Main work sections should fit within remaining time
- EMOM calculations: (workSec + restSec) × rounds = total time (e.g., 45s+15s × 12 = 12:00)
- Custom intervals: "Every 1:10" = 70s total (calculate work:rest ratio), "Every 3:30" = 210s total
- AMRAP/FOR_TIME: Duration should be realistic for training level
  * BEGINNER: 8-12 min AMRAPs, 15-20 min FOR_TIME caps
  * INTERMEDIATE: 10-15 min AMRAPs, 20-30 min FOR_TIME caps
  * ADVANCED: 12-20 min AMRAPs, 30-45 min FOR_TIME caps
  * ELITE: 15-25 min AMRAPs, 45-60 min FOR_TIME caps
  * HYROX: 20-40 min AMRAPs, 30-60 min FOR_TIME caps (long endurance blocks)
- FOR_TIME with rounds: "1:40 Cap × 4 Rounds" = durationSec: 100, rounds: 4, restBetweenRounds: 30-45
- Total workout time = WARMUP + Main Work + FINISHER (optional) + COOLDOWN
- Always leave 2-3 minutes buffer for transitions
- ⚠️ NEVER create a section without durationSec (or emomWorkSec/intervalWorkSec for EMOM/INTERVAL)

TIER PRESCRIPTION GUIDELINES:
- SILVER (Beginner/Intermediate): Focus on mechanics, lighter loads, steady pace, completion goal
- GOLD (Advanced): Standard RX weights, challenging pace, requires established strength base
- BLACK (Elite): Competition standard, heavy loading, high intensity, failure is likely
- Use exercise tier prescriptions from the database when available, otherwise estimate based on:
  * Training level (BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE → SILVER, ADVANCED → GOLD, ELITE → BLACK)
  * Exercise complexity
  * Movement pattern
  * Typical use (CONDITIONING exercises = higher reps, FINISHER = max effort)
- ALWAYS generate all three tiers (SILVER, GOLD, BLACK) for each exercise block so users can scale up/down

CRITICAL: ERG MACHINES & DISTANCE-BASED EXERCISES - MANDATORY RULES:
- For erg machines (Rower, Row, SkiErg, Ski, Bike, Bike Erg, Assault Bike, Echo Bike, BikeErg, or any exercise name containing "row", "bike", "ski", "erg"):
  * ⚠️ MANDATORY: You MUST include distance/calories in ALL THREE tiers (tierSilver, tierGold, tierBlack)
  * ⚠️ DO NOT use "N/A", "null", or leave distance empty for erg machines
  * ⚠️ DO NOT use a single distance/calories at the block level - each tier MUST be different
  * tierSilver: Lower distance/calories (e.g., 500m row, 12 cal bike, 400m ski)
  * tierGold: Medium distance/calories (e.g., 800m row, 15 cal bike, 600m ski)
  * tierBlack: Higher distance/calories (e.g., 1000m row, 18 cal bike, 800m ski)
  * Use calories (cal) for bike/assault bike exercises
  * Use meters (m) for rower/ski erg exercises
  * Example progression: SILVER: 12 cal, GOLD: 15 cal, BLACK: 18 cal (bike)
  * Example progression: SILVER: 500m, GOLD: 800m, BLACK: 1000m (rower)
  * If you see "Bike Erg", "Row", "SkiErg", "Bike", etc. in exerciseName, distance/calories are REQUIRED in all tiers
- For bodyweight exercises that use distance (Burpee Broad Jumps, Shuttle Runs, etc.):
  * tierSilver: Shorter distance (e.g., 20m, 30m)
  * tierGold: Medium distance (e.g., 40m, 50m)
  * tierBlack: Longer distance (e.g., 60m, 80m)
- For loaded exercises (dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells):
  * Use different loads per tier (as normal)
  * Distance/calories are NOT required unless it's a distance-based loaded movement (e.g., Farmers Carry)
- For bodyweight exercises with reps (Push-ups, Pull-ups, etc.):
  * Use different targetReps per tier (as normal)
  * Distance/calories are NOT required

REALISTIC WORKOUT DESIGN:
- Ensure workouts are challenging but achievable within the time limit
- Consider equipment transitions and setup time
- Balance intensity with volume based on training level
- Progressive difficulty: BASE < LOAD < INTENSIFY > DELOAD
- Running distances: 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1km are common. Only include if "running route" is in equipment.
- Avoid unrealistic rep schemes or distances that would exceed time limits
- Match exercise selection to available equipment and space requirements

Design workouts that are challenging, progressive, realistic, and aligned with the user's goals, equipment, and time constraints.`;

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - REVL-LEVEL DETAIL:

1. REP SCHEMES - NEVER use vague numbers:
   - ✅ CORRECT: "10-8-8-8", "16-14-12", "8-7-6-5+", "4-3-2-1-1"
   - ❌ WRONG: "10 reps", "some reps", "AMRAP" (unless truly unlimited)
   - Show progression: descending, ascending, or wave patterns
   - For AMRAP sections, specify target rep ranges per round

2. LOAD SPECIFICATIONS - ALWAYS include:
   - Percentage-based: "@ 40-45-50-55%" (progressive across rounds)
   - OR Tier-specific loads: "12 kg / 20 kg / 28 kg"
   - Show progression if multiple rounds

3. TEMPO NOTATION - Include when relevant:
   - "2220" = 2s down, 2s pause, 2s up, 0s pause
   - "2s pause" = pause at bottom
   - "3s eccentric" = slow lowering
   - "First 4 Reps: R1-2 = 2220" = tempo for specific reps/rounds

4. EXERCISE NAMING - Use REVL conventions:
   - Full descriptive names: "BB FFE Rev Lunge", "SA DB Strict Press"
   - Include equipment: "DBall", "KB", "BB", "SA" (Single Arm), "Alt" (Alternating)
   - Specify variations: "TNG" (Touch and Go), "FFE" (Front Foot Elevated), "KOT" (Knee Over Toe)

5. EVERY exercise block MUST include:
   - Specific rep scheme (not vague)
   - All three tiers (tierSilver, tierGold, tierBlack) with specific loads/reps
   - Load percentages OR tier-specific loads
   - Tempo notation when applicable
   - Clear description with form cues

6. SECTION TIMING - Be explicit and support ALL REVL formats:
   - "1:40 Cap × 4 Rounds" = FOR_TIME with durationSec: 100, rounds: 4, restBetweenRounds: 30-45
   - "8:00 Cap — 5 Rounds" = FOR_TIME with durationSec: 480, rounds: 5, restBetweenRounds: 45-60
   - "30:00 Cap" = FOR_TIME with durationSec: 1800 (HYROX-style long cap)
   - "Every 1:10 × 12" = INTERVAL with intervalWorkSec: 60, intervalRestSec: 10, intervalRounds: 12 (total 70s per round)
   - "Every 3:30 × 4" = INTERVAL with intervalWorkSec: 180, intervalRestSec: 30, intervalRounds: 4 (total 210s per round)
   - "E2MOM × 8" = INTERVAL with intervalWorkSec: 90, intervalRestSec: 30, intervalRounds: 8 (total 120s per round)
   - "E4MOM × 2" = INTERVAL with intervalWorkSec: 180, intervalRestSec: 60, intervalRounds: 2 (total 240s per round)
   - "EMOM × 16" = EMOM with emomWorkSec: 45, emomRestSec: 15, emomRounds: 16
   - Always calculate total time: (work + rest) × rounds OR (intervalWorkSec + intervalRestSec) × intervalRounds

7. BLOCK STRUCTURES - When multiple blocks:
   - Label clearly: "Block A (14-12-10)", "Block B (12-10-8)"
   - Show rep progression for each block
   - "2 Blocks Every 1:10 × 12" = Create 2 SUPERSET sections, each with INTERVAL timing (70s intervals)
   - Use section.note to explain block rotation: "Rotate between Block A and Block B every 1:10. Complete 12 rounds total (6 of each block)."

8. PAIR/TEAM WORK - Specify format in section.note:
   - "In Pairs 1:1" = one works, one rests (specify in note)
   - "In Pairs YGIG" = You Go I Go alternating (specify in note)
   - "Teams of 3-4" = team format (specify in note)
   - Include partner/team instructions in section.note field

CRITICAL TIME CONSTRAINTS:
- Total workout must fit within ${params.availableMinutes} minutes
- WARMUP: 5-10 minutes
- COOLDOWN: 5 minutes
- Main work sections: ${params.availableMinutes - 15} minutes maximum (accounting for warmup/cooldown)
- If generating multiple workouts, each must independently fit within ${params.availableMinutes} minutes

EQUIPMENT NOTES:
${hasRunningRoute ? '- Running route available: You may include running distances (100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1km) in workouts' : '- NO running route available: Do NOT include running exercises or distances'}
- Only use exercises that match the available equipment list
- Ensure all exercises are realistic for the training level and equipment available

Generate workouts that are effective, time-appropriate, challenging but achievable, and properly structured with all three tiers for every exercise.`;

Min 4: 20m Sandbag Lunges (20/14 kg)
Min 5: 100m Row
REST 2:00
Repeat 3 more rounds
FINISHER: 2km Run for time

REVL/HYROX REP SCHEME PATTERNS:
- Descending reps: 100 → 80 → 60 → 40 → 20
- Ascending reps: 10 → 15 → 20 → 25 → 30
- Round-based: 5 rounds of 20/15/10
- Time-based: AMRAP 12:00, FOR_TIME with cap
- Distance-based: 100m, 200m, 400m, 1km runs/rows
- Mixed modal: Run → Station → Run → Station pattern

REVL SPRINT SESSION EXAMPLES:
Example 1 - Bike Sprint Intervals:
"REVL SPRINT // 01"
WARMUP: 5 min easy bike
INTERVAL:
- Exercise: Bike Erg (Max Effort)
- intervalWorkSec: 20 (20 seconds max effort)
- intervalRestSec: 100 (100 seconds rest)
- intervalRounds: 8
- Total time: (20 + 100) × 8 = 960 seconds = 16 minutes
COOLDOWN: 5 min easy bike

Example 2 - Mixed Sprint Session:
"REVL POWER // 02"
WARMUP: 5 min
INTERVAL:
- Exercise: Assault Bike (Max Effort)
- intervalWorkSec: 30
- intervalRestSec: 90
- intervalRounds: 6
- Total time: (30 + 90) × 6 = 720 seconds = 12 minutes
FINISHER: 3 rounds: 10 Cal Bike + 10 KB Swings
COOLDOWN: 5 min

Common INTERVAL patterns:
- 20s work / 100s rest (1:5 ratio) - Power development
- 30s work / 90s rest (1:3 ratio) - Anaerobic capacity
- 15s work / 45s rest (1:3 ratio) - Speed/power
- 40s work / 80s rest (1:2 ratio) - Capacity work
- Rounds typically: 6-10 for power, 8-12 for capacity

Use INTERVAL section type for REVL-style sprint sessions with specific work:rest ratios.

Use these patterns and exercise names when generating workouts.`;
