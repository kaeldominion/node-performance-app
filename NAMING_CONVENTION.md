# NØDE Naming Convention - Branding Decision

## Current Usage in Codebase

- **Metadata**: "NØDE Performance App"
- **Landing Page Badge**: "Performance OS"
- **README**: "NØDE Performance App"
- **Various UI**: Just "NØDE"

## Option 1: NØDE OS

### Pros
- ✅ **Shorter, cleaner** - More memorable and punchy
- ✅ **Tech-forward** - "OS" implies infrastructure/platform
- ✅ **Scalable** - Can expand beyond just "performance" (NØDE OS for coaches, gyms, etc.)
- ✅ **Modern** - Aligns with tech companies (iOS, macOS, etc.)
- ✅ **Flexible** - Can add descriptors contextually ("NØDE OS for Performance Training")

### Cons
- ❌ **Less descriptive** - Doesn't immediately convey "performance training"
- ❌ **Generic** - "OS" could mean anything
- ❌ **Requires context** - Need marketing copy to explain what it is

### Use Cases
- Main brand name
- Product name
- Domain: `nodeos.com` or `node-os.com`
- Tagline: "NØDE OS - Performance Training Infrastructure"

## Option 2: NØDE Performance OS

### Pros
- ✅ **Self-explanatory** - Immediately clear what it does
- ✅ **SEO-friendly** - "Performance" is a key search term
- ✅ **Professional** - Sounds like enterprise software
- ✅ **Specific** - Clearly positioned in performance training space

### Cons
- ❌ **Longer** - More verbose, harder to say
- ❌ **Less flexible** - Tied to "performance" (what if you expand to nutrition, recovery, etc.?)
- ❌ **Redundant** - "Performance OS" might be redundant if OS already implies performance infrastructure

### Use Cases
- Full product name
- Marketing materials
- Domain: `nodeperformanceos.com` (longer)
- Tagline: "NØDE Performance OS - Training Infrastructure"

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Primary: "NØDE OS"
### Secondary: "NØDE Performance OS" (for clarity when needed)

**Usage:**
- **Brand/Logo**: "NØDE OS"
- **Marketing/Taglines**: "NØDE OS - Performance Training Infrastructure"
- **Full Name (when needed)**: "NØDE Performance OS"
- **Short Form**: "NØDE"

**Examples:**
- Landing page hero: "NØDE OS"
- Badge: "Performance OS" (descriptor)
- Meta title: "NØDE OS - Performance Training Platform"
- Footer: "© NØDE OS"

## Recommendation: **NØDE OS** (with "Performance" as descriptor)

### Rationale
1. **Scalability** - You're building an OS/platform, not just a performance app
2. **Brand Strength** - Shorter names are stronger brands
3. **Flexibility** - Can add "Performance" contextually without being locked in
4. **Modern** - Aligns with how tech companies name platforms
5. **Your Landing Page Already Uses This** - "Performance OS" badge suggests OS is the core brand

### Implementation
- **Primary Brand**: "NØDE OS"
- **Tagline**: "Performance Training Infrastructure" or "The Performance OS"
- **Full Name (legal/marketing)**: "NØDE Performance OS" when needed for clarity
- **Short Form**: "NØDE" in casual contexts

## Current Inconsistencies to Fix

1. Metadata title: "NØDE Performance App" → "NØDE OS"
2. Landing page badge: "Performance OS" → Keep as descriptor, or "NØDE OS"
3. README: "NØDE Performance App" → "NØDE OS"
4. Package names: Keep technical names, but update display names

## Questions to Consider

1. **Future expansion?** Will you add nutrition, recovery, coaching tools? → Favors "NØDE OS"
2. **Target audience?** Tech-savvy lifters? → Favors "NØDE OS"
3. **Brand positioning?** Infrastructure/platform or training app? → OS suggests infrastructure
4. **Marketing clarity?** Need immediate understanding? → Favors "Performance OS"

## My Vote: **NØDE OS**

Clean, scalable, modern, and your landing page already positions it as an OS. "Performance" can be the descriptor/tagline.
